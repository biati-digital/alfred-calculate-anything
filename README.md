# Calculate Anything

Calculate Anything is a workflow for Alfred 4, that uses **natural language** and is able to calculate multiple things like currency, time, vat, px, em, rem, percentage, and more.

</p>

## Why

There are several conversion workflows out there but I wanted a workflow that worked naturally. For example, you can open Alfred, type `100 + 9` and get a result. No need for keywords or hotkeys -- it just works. With Calculate Anything you can do the same, simply type `100 + 16%`, `100 euros to usd`, `100km in cm` or `100 years to hours` and many more.

## Features

- **Natural language** - type `100 euros to dollars`, `100 euros in usd`, `100€ to $`, `100eur usd`, `100 euros a dolares` -- it does not matter, the same result will be displayed
- **Currency** - Up to 168 currencies
- **Cryptocurrency** - Support for 100 cryptocurrencies
- **Units** - `100 kilometers to meters` or `100 km to m` or simply `100km m`
- **Data Storage** - `100 gigabytes in megabytes`, `2 gb to mb`, `400MiB to kib`, `2tb gb` etc.
- **Percentages** - `100 + 16%`, `100 - 16%`, `40 as a % of 50`, `20 is what % of 50` etc.
- **px,em,rem,pt** - `12px` or `12px to em` or `12px pt`
- **Time** - `time +15 years`, `time now plus 6 hours` or convert a timestamp
- **VAT** - value added tax calculations, we all need this
- **Translations** You can create your own translations to display results in your language
- **Keywords** Extend the natural language support so you can type `100 dolares a pesos` and see the result of `100usd to mxn`

## Requirements for Mac OS Monterey Users and up

Starting from Mac OS Monterey Apple removed PHP so you have to install it manually, that can easily be done with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), just open your terminal and paste the commands below:

1.- Install Homebrew
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2.- Install PHP
```
brew install php
```

That's it, you need to have the latest version of Alfred and will automatically find the PHP version that you install.

Mac OS Big Sur users and below do not need to do anything as your Mac OS already includes PHP.

## Download

Make sure to download the latest released directly from the releases page. [Download here](https://github.com/biati-digital/alfred-calculate-anything/releases/).

## Base Configuration

There's only one global setting and that's the language. This setting will allow you to type in Alfred using your own language and also will change the notifications and texts. View the Translations section for the available languages.

Configure it with:

- In Alfred type `ca`, select **Set base language** and select the language you want to use. You can also type `ca lang`

[View the configuration section for more info](#configuration).

## Currency

You can use natural language or a few characters -- that's all! For example:

```
- 100 us dollars in mexican pesos
- 100 canadian dollars in argentinian peso
- 100 euros to dollars
- 100 euros in dollars
- 100 euros as dollars
- 100 euros a dolares (you can also write it in your own language)
- 100 usd to mxn
- 100 usd mxn
- 100usd yen
- 100€ to $
- 100 ¥ in €
- 100¥ €
- 100eur (if no target the currency will be converted to the base currencies that you configured)
```

You can set a base currencies so if you type for example **120 euros** it will be automatically converted to the currencies that you configured.

All these examples just work. You can add spaces between the value and the currency or not.

</p>

### Currency Modifiers

When a result is displayed you can use action modifiers to copy the value in different formats:

- **Return**
Press Return to copy the value with format, for example 2,376.54
- **Command + Return**
Press Command + Return to copy the value without formatting, for example 2376.54
- **Option + Return**
Press Option + Return to copy the value of a single unit, for example 23.76

### Currency Options

By default the workflow will use exchangeratehost api to make the conversion. exchangeratehost only support 32 currencies; if you need support for additional currencies supported by Calculate Anything, you need to get a _free_ API key from [https://fixer.io](https://fixer.io) -- it takes less than a minute!

The following options are available for each currency. Simply launch Alfred, type `ca` and select any of the options below. [View the configuration section for more info](#configuration).

- **Add base currency**
This will become your base currency, if you type `100eur` it will automatically be converted to the currencies you define here. You can define multiple currencies by repeating the process.
- **Delete base currency**
If you no longer want a base currency you can select this option to list all configured base currencies, you can delete a currency by simply pressing Return
- **Set currency format**
Used to format the converted amount, you will see a list of formats to choose from, simply press return to select a format.
- **Set Fixer API**
Set your fixer API Key for support more currencies, after you select this option just copy paste your Key and press Return to save it.

**The currencies are updated every 24 hours, if you need to update this more often you can set a custom interval.** To do this you need to [Set a Workflow Environment Variables](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/). The name should be `currency_cache_interval` and the value should be the number of hours, for example, to update every 6 hours you need to set the value to `6`. Only do this if you know what you are doing and you understand that the API has limits.


### Currency Symbols

You can use currency symbols in your query. For example `100¥ to €` will be converted from 100 Japanese yen to the equivalent in Euros. Here is a list of available symbols:

**If by any chance you don't remember the currency symbol or abbreviation simply type `ca list` and select "List Available Currencies"**

## Cryptocurrency

Calculate Anything can convert between 5,000 cryptocurrencies and you can define your own. Again, you can use natural language or simply pass the currency symbol.

```
- 2 bitcoins to dollars
- 0.1 bitcoin in dollars
- 5 bitcoins in ethereum
- 1 ethereum to ¥
- 10 ethereum in mxn
- 1eth btc
- 1btc (if no target currency is provided, the configured base currency will be used)
```

### Cryptocurrency Modifiers

When a result is displayed you can use action modifiers to copy the value in different formats:

- **Return**
Press Return to copy the value with format, for example 2,376.54
- **Command + Return**
Press Command + Return to copy the value without formatting, for example 2376.54

### Cryptocurrency Options

You need to get a free API key from [https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/). This takes less than a minute.

The following options are available for cryptocurrency conversions. Simply launch Alfred, type `ca` and select any of the options below. [View the configuration section for more info](#configuration).

- **Set Coinmarketcap API**
Select this option, paste your API key and press Return to save it.

- **Add custom cryptocurrency**
  The workflow includes up to 5,000 cryptocurrencies. if you need a cryptocurrency that it's not included, you can select this option and enter the cryptocurrency symbol, for example `SATS` for Satoshi, if you do not know the symbol go to [https://coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com), search for the cryptocurrency and the symbol will be at the right side of the cryptocurrency name.

- **Remove custom cryptocurrency**
  Select this option to remove a custom cryptocurrency if no longer needed.

**The cryptocurrencies are updated every 24 hours, if you need to update this more often you can set a custom interval.** To do this you need to [Set a Workflow Environment Variables](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/). The name should be `cryptocurrency_cache_interval` and the value should be the number of hours, for example, to update every 6 hours you need to set the value to `6`. Only do this if you know what you are doing and you understand that the API has limits.


## Units

You can write your query using natural language or just a few characters. Either way works!

```
- 100 kilometers to meters
- 100 km in meters
- 100 km m
- 100km m

- 100 miles as meters
- 100miles in meters
- 100 miles to m

- 100 ounces to kilograms
- 100oz to kg
- 100oz = kg
- 100oz kg

- 10 years to months
- 10years to seconds
- 10 years hr
- 1 year to sec
- 1hr secods
- 1hr s
- 10 days hr
- 10 días a horas (use your own language)
```

If you don't remember the unit abbreviation, simply type the name of the unit. For example, instead of "oz" you can type "ounce" or "ounces" or even use words in your own language like "onza" or "onzas" in Spanish.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/gifts/units-v3.gif?raw=true">
</p>

Finally, if you still don't remember the unit's abbreviation or name simply type `ca list` and select **List Available Units**. From there you can type to filter, etc.

## Data Storage

You can write your query using natural language or just a few characters. Either way works!

```
- 100 gigabytes in megabytes
- 100 gigas in megas
- 100 Mebibytes in Kibibytes
- 100 gb to mb
- 100gb to kb
- 100gb mb
- 400MiB in kib
- 2tb gb
- 1b kb
```

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/gifts/datastorage-v3.gif?raw=true">
</p>

Please note, this workflow follows the **IEC Standard (International Electrotechnical Commission)** as it had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, and NIST. That means that if you type `1MB in KB` you will get `1000 KB` but if you type `1MiB in KiB` you will get `1024 KB`, you can read more about it here [Multiple-byte_units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units)

Do you prefer **1 MB = 1024 KB**? No problem, you can configure it, checkout **Data Storage Options**.

### Data Storage Modifiers

When a result is displayed you can use action modifiers to copy the value in different formats:

- **Return**
Press Return to copy the value with format, for example 2,376.54
- **Command + Return**
Press Command + Return to copy the value without formatting, for example 2376.54

### Data Storage Options

There's no exactly "options" it's more of a way for people to overwrite the conversion and **use always the Binary mode so `1 MB = 1024 KB`**. To enable this you need to [Set a Workflow Environment Variables](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/). The name should be `datastorage_force_binary` and the value should be `true`.

#### Data Storage Available Units

Unit     | Unit Name
------   | -----------
B        | Byte
kB       | Kilobyte
MB       | Megabyte
GB       | Gigabyte
TB       | Terabyte
PB       | Petabyte
EB       | Exabyte
ZB       | Zettabyte
YB       | Yottabyte
bit      | bit
KiB      | Kibibyte
MiB      | Mebibyte
GiB      | Gibibyte
TiB      | Tebibyte
PiB      | Pebibyte
EiB      | Exbibyte
ZiB      | Zebibyte
YiB      | Yobibyte


## Percentages

You can easily calculate percentages. For example:

```
- 40 as a % of 50  // 40 is 80% of 50
- 20 is what % of 50 // 20 is 40% of 50
- 15% of 50 = 7.50  // 7.5 equals to 15% of 50
- 120 + 30% = 156  // 120 plus the 30% of 120
- 120 plus 30% = 156  // 120 plus the 30% of 120
- 120 - 30% = 84  // 120 minus the 30% of 120
- 120 minus 30% = 84  // 120 minus the 30% of 120
- 30 % 40 = 75%  // 30 is 75% of 40

Translations and natural language can also be used
- 120 más 30% = 156
- 120 menos 10% = 108
- 40 como % de 50 = // 40 es 80% de 50
```

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/gifts/percentages-v3.gif?raw=true">
</p>

## PX, EM, REM, PT

Open Alfred, type `12px` and you'll see the value converted to em, rem and pt. It's that simple. Check the examples below.

```
- 12px
- 12px to em
- 2 rem
- 2rem
- 2rem to pt

# use a custom px base or configure it in the workflow
- 12px in em base 17px
```

### px,em,rem,pt Options

The following options are available. Simply launch Alfred, type `ca` and select any of the options below. [View the configuration section for more info](#configuration).

- **Set base pixels** The base pixels for calculations (the value must be in px), for example **16px**

## Time

Given its less frequently used, time conversions require the use of the keyword **time**.

```
# converts the timestamp to a regular date
- time 1577836800

# gives you the time from now plus 15 days
- time +15 days
- time now plus 3 days

# gives you the time from now plus 3 working days
- time today + 3 workdays
- time now + 3 workdays
- time + 3 workdays

# number of days until specified date
- time days until 31 december

# the start date of current year
- time start of year

# the start date of specified year
- time start of 2021

# the end date of current year
- time end of year

# the end date of specified year
- time end of 2021

# it also works in your language
- time inicio de 2020
- time fin de 2020
- time dias hasta 31 diciembre

# get information about date
- time 31 December, 2021 18:00:00
- time 31/12/2021 18:00:00
- time 12/31/2021 18:00:00

# calculate the difference between two dates
- time 25 December, 2021 - 31 December, 2021
- time 31-11-2019 - 21-11-2019
- time 11/31/2019 - 11/21/2019
```

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/gifts/time-v3.gif?raw=true">
</p>

### Time Options

The following options are available.  Simply launch Alfred, type `ca` and select any of the options below. [View the configuration section for more info](#configuration).

- **Set base timezone** Base time zone used to calculate dates in your time zone, search and select your zone from the list and press Return to save it.

- **Add date format** Configure a new date format so the date is displayed the way you want, for example **j F, Y, g:i:s a** ([more information about available values for date](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php))

- **Delete date format** It will show you a list of configured date formats, simply select the one you want to delete and press Return to remove it

### Example: Adding Date and Time Formats

You can add formats for your dates and times. Simply launch Alfred, type `ca` and select the option **Add date format**. Enter the format you want and press Return. [View the configuration section for more info](#configuration).

Time will use the language that you configure with **Set base language**.

## VAT (Value Added Tax)

With this you can calculate the VAT for a given amount. Like time, VAT is also triggered with a keyword. By default, the keyword is "vat" but you can change the keyword in the workflow.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/gifts/vat-v3.gif?raw=true">
</p>

Given the following query

```
vat of 400 (with a 16% VAT configured, a percentage you can configure)
```

Calculate Anything will provide the following conversions:

- VAT of 400 = 64 (the VAT amount)
- 400 plus VAT = 464 (the Amount plus VAT)
- 400 minus VAT = 344.82 (the Amount minus VAT, useful if you have a final amount and want to know the VAT applied)

### VAT Options

The following options are available. Simply launch Alfred, type `ca` and select any of the options below. [View the configuration section for more info](#configuration).

- **Set VAT percentage** the VAT percentage to apply,for example 16%

## Translations

This is a list of available languages:

Language   | Code
------     | -----------
English    | en_EN
Spanish    | es_ES

To create your own translation, just follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste `/lang/en_EN.php` and `/lang/en_EN-keys.php` into the same folder
2. Change the name of the pasted files to your country lang code, for example `ru_RU.php` and `ru_RU-keys.php`
3. Open and translate `ru_RU.php`
4. Open and modify `ru_RU-keys.php`. **Read more about this file in the section Keywords**.
5. Set your new language with `ca lang` (Your new language should be detected automatically)
6. Share it with the world -- and me! (I welcome pull requests or links to services like pastebin.com)

## Keywords

Keywords are words that can be used when writing a query in natural language. For example, by default, the keyword "ounces" will be converted to "oz", "kilometers" will be converted to "km" and "dollars" will be converted to "USD". Keywords allow the user to type in a more natural way and in their own language.

```
'units' => [
    'hours' => 'hr',
    'hour' => 'hr',
    'kilometers' => 'km',
    'ounces' => 'oz',
    'ounce' => 'oz',
    'hakunamatata' => 'year',  // try adding this
    ...
],

If the user the types:
1 hakunamatata to months, the result will be 12

```

There is no limit to the keywords that you can add.

## **Stop Words**

Stop words are words that can be used in the query when using natural language, for example `100km to cm`. Here the stop word is "to".

Stop words are useful for two things:

1. Allow the user to write more naturally and in their own language (e.g 100 dolares a mxn) "a" is the stop word
2. Check if the query has to be processed

For example:

`100km equals meters`

If the word "equals" is not registered in the `stop_words` array then it won't be processed. After processing, stop words are removed so `100km to cm` is understood as `100km cm`.

You can modify stop words in the same keys file, for example `/lang/en_EN-keys.php`.

```
'units' => [
    'hours' => 'hr',
    'hour' => 'hr',

    'stop_words' => ['to', '=']
    ...
],

```

## Configuration

You can easily configure the Calculate Anything workflow. Simply open Alfred, type `ca` and you will see a list of all the available options to configure the workflow. You can also filter the options for example launch Alfred and start typing `ca fixer` and you will automatically see the options filtered. To select an option just press Return.

The workflow stores some data about currency in the workflow data folder. You can delete the cache by opening Alfred and typing `ca clear`. You can decide between deleting the cache, delete stored settings or both.

## Updates

The workflow will check for updates in the background every 15 days and will notify you when a new update is available. If you want to check for updates manually, launch Alfred and type `ca update`.

## Performance

For currency, percentage and unit conversions, Calculate Anything will only process the query if it begins with a digit and has at least 3 characters. Time and VAT conversions need a keyword because they are not often used.

## Acknowledgements

This workflow would not be possible without:

- [Convertor](https://github.com/olifolkerd/convertor) with some modifications
