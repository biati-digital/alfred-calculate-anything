# Calculate Anything Alfred 4

The workflow had several changes to comply with the Alfred Workflows Gallery, this means that the self updater was removed and also the old way to configure the workflow was removed.

If you already have and older version of this workflow configured it should work without problems, but if you are a new user and you want to install this workflow in Alfred 4 in order to configure it you need to set Environment Variables.

## Configuration

This is a list of Environment Variables that you can use to configure the workflow.

- `language` the value can be `en_EN`, `es_ES` or `sv_SE`
